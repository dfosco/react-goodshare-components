React.js components for social share. A simple way to share a link on the pages of your website in the most popular (and not so) social networks. Powered by [goodshare.js](https://github.com/koddr/goodshare.js) project.

## Features

React-ready&trade; components, simple install, extensive documentation, developer support, **SEO friendly**, many options for customization of appearance, **clean code without scripts tracking user activity** on the page, **high speed**.

Beautiful button design **already included**. Just open documentation, copy-paste and save!

We're using [Flow](https://flow.org/en/): A **Static Type** Checker for JavaScript.

## Requirements

- React >= 16.x
- React DOM >= 16.x

## Install

```bash
$ npm i --save react-goodshare-components
```

## Usage

Schema for name of React goodshare.js components:

- `<...>Button` — full styled component (include styles, share button and counter)
- `<...>ShareLink` — only share link (include share link without any styles)
- `<...>ShareCounter` — only share counter (include share counter without any styles)

Where `<...>` is the name of social network or messenger (first letter is capital, of course). For example, if you're want to render Facebook social network all-in-one button (with share link, counter and awesome styles):
 
```js
import { FacebookButton } from "react-goodshare-components";
```
